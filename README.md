# Identification App with ModelArts(Huawei Cloud)

Description: 
An algorithm based on the identification of photographs taken from the database. First of all, my data is defined, then a result is produced for the data entered by the user over the defined data.
The data type considered in this project is flower images. Of course, the type can be changed according to the need.
The benefit of the project is to compare the taught data in a very short time, regardless of the number of numbers, and present it to the user.
It can be used very comfortably in applications such as security areas, face scanning systems, predictive models..
